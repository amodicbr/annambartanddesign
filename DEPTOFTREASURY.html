                        It’s full of confusing jargon that make it accessible to ONE specific kind of User. It’s hard to read AND it’s difficult to  find what you’re looking buried within the large blocks of text that crowd the website.

                        Resources for YOU! 
                        Resources for YOUR Business.

                        I conducted every round of interviews and analyzed the data, I used this information to inform and iterate on my design. 
                        
                        In the final round of design iteration I created  design animations that organized content in a friendly and innovative way. </p>

                This was an independently produced project created without any stakeholder input. 
                
                Given the opportunity to work in this way I took many risks and aimed to make my design as innovative as possible. 
                
                In the real world... or if I were working in a professional capacity with the intention of launching this site immediately, I would have approached almost all of my design choices differently.
                
                This is all to say please view the choices I made with this in mind.
                They reflect a desire to push boundaries and think about what might be possible when designing Gov’t and all websites someday. </p>

            <p class="center"><br></br>I began with a Proto Persona. 
                When imagining this person I wanted to focus on someone like me, and many other Americans. Someone who is not the MOST financially literate and savvy but who strives to understand how and what to do with their money.<br></br>
                
                Because I was focused on this kind of user I chose to analyze the user path to the auctions page.</p>

            <p>I chose this route because it’s something that almost any person could follow. It is straight forward and easy to understand  unlike many of the other pages which require previous knowledge about how money operates to comprehend what you’re looking at.</p>

                     <p>After I established my Proto Persona I started doing a detailed analysis of the path this User would take when navigating to the Auctions page. 

                    This path presented an extra challenge because the Auction pages lack any kind of cohesion with the rest of the Treasury site. 
                     You feel like you’ve entered a completely different site that hasn’t been updated in decades. </p>

I wasn't super happy with how the colors were coming together despite all my attempts at working them into the design. On top of my hesitation my mentor encouraged me to move away from purple because it can sometimes cause a feeling of unease amongst users.</p>
                    <p class="right">I definitely didn't want the site to give any inkling of uncertainty or lack of trustworthiness so with that note I scrapped the purple and began playing with different color pallets.</p>

            <p>As I continued on my design journey I started to solidify some design themes. </p>
            <p>I wanted to emmulate the architecture of traditional buildings like the New York public library.</p>
            <p>For the overall "feel" of the site I looked at a classic, upscale Law Office- think Richard Gilmore.</p> 
            <p>As I was iterating I was taking in and noticing design in the world around me. On my way home one afternoon I noticied the Lincoln Center Subway sign and snapped a photo of it to draw inspiration from.</p>

        <h2>Iterating, Iterating, Iterating</h2>
        <p>So much of my design process was spent iterating.</p>
        <p>Below you can see some of the many iterations I went through. They were not all pretty!! 
        <p>But they were all a part of the process.</p>
        <div><img src="/IMGS/Treasury IMGS/Header I.png" class="img-fluid"></div>
        <p>I played with colors and styles and tried a lot of different things because I wanted to push boundaries. Throughout this process I did a lot of casual testing amongst friends and mentors and I frequently asked for feedback while I worked towards my final design.</p>
        <p>I made many small changes based on peer reviews.</p>
        <div><img src="/IMGS/Treasury IMGS/FYP.png" class="img-fluid"></div>
        <p>Early on I was playing with large ornate page breakers that I wanted to use like the elaborate window dressings you see on pre-war buildings. This ultimately didn't work and confused users so I removed it.</p>
        <div><img src="/IMGS/Treasury IMGS/Iteracting Header.png" class="img-fluid"></div>
        <p>I continued towards finding a theme using columns, inspired by the front of the Department of Treasury building. I ended up using images of the Treasury building throughout the final design.</p>

<h1>Adding Animations</h1>

<br></br>

<div class="Proto">
    <p>In my final leg of designing I added animations to the homepage and fleshed out my mobile design. 
        I wanted to push myself and my skills and give myself a real challenge. 
        I also wanted to think about organizing content online in new and interesting ways than we typically see.

                                <ul class="TY">I will continue to test and iterate Lift Up’s High-Fidelity design, while working on developing the experiences themselves. 

                                    Ideally Lift Up will operate like YouTube or TikTok and allow creators to upload their own unique experiences for Users to enjoy.
